Paperclip is a tiny language that enables you to create presentational components for any framework. Here's what it looks like:

```html

<!-- this style block is scoped to the document that it's defined in -->
<style>
  .font-regular {
    font-family: Inter;
    font-size: 0.8em;
  }
</style>

<div export component as="Message" className="font-regular">
  {children}
</div>
```

Paperclip modules can be imported directly into your regular code like so:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Message } from "./my-module.pc";

ReactDOM.render(<Message>
  Hello Paperclip!
</Message>, document.body);
```

### Why?

Paperclip was created to be a generic approach to building durable HTML & CSS. That means:

- **No global CSS**. With Paperclip, CSS is scoped to the document it's defined in, so you don't have to worry about styles leaking out.
- **Confidently make HTML & CSS changes**. Paperclip comes with visual regression tooling that allows you to easily track _all_ visual changes in Paperclip files, so you can feel comfortable making big change without breaking production. 
- **Long shelf life for UIs**.




Build UIs at the speed of thought. Paperclip is a template engine that comes with tools for building presentational components in realtime, all within your existing IDE:

- Scoped CSS. Write styles however you want, without worying about them leaking out.
- [Percy](https://percy.io) integration for catching visual regressions.
- Compatible with existing CSS libraries like Tailwind, Bulma, and Bootstrap.

## Roadmap

What's the future looking like for Paperclip? Here's the tentative plan:

1. âœ… Prettier integration
2. âœ… Avocode / Figma integration (Figma to design sync)
3. ðŸ”² CSS & HTML linting (a11y, showing unused styles, caniuse integration)
4. ðŸ”² CSS tree shaking (removing unused CSS from builds)
5. ðŸ”² Visual builder (no-code like)
6. ðŸ”² Multiple compiler targets: PHP, Ruby, VueJS, Svelte
7. ðŸ”² IDE integrations
