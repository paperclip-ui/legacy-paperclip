                Writing HTML and CSS for large codebases is hard, especially
                with global styles, slow developer tooling, and lack of
                automation for catching visual regressions. Paperclip is a tiny
                language that focuses purely on these problems, with features to
                help you build maintainable UIs more quickly, and accurately.
