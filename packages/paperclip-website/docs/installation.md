To get started with Paperclip, just run this command in your project directory:

```
npx paperclip-cli init
```

This will walk you through the setup process that will ask you to pick a target compiler. After it's done running, you'll notice a few new files. Next, just run this command:

```
npx paperclip-cli build
```

You should notice a few more generated files - these ones can be imported directly into your codebase.

And that's it! You're ready to start using Paperclip.
