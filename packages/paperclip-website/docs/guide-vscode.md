The [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crcn.@paperclipui/vscode) provides a richer experience for Paperclp that includes code highlighting, intellisense, and realtime visual development.

### Tips

- To **Open a live preview**, execute the `Paperclip: Live Preview` while a `*.pc` file is open.
- You can open the **web inspector** by running the command: `Developer: Open Webview Developer tools`.
- If the extension stops working for whatever reason (might happen during Alpha), then run the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
